                </font>
                <p>
                    With so many resources across different apps and the internet, users can get lost in a sea of
                    information and feel overwhelmed. Some aspect that can be overwhelming is finding new places to eat
                    and things to do when in an unfamiliar area while traveling. Some constraints that the user can
                    face includes accommodating preferences of others in their group, dietary restriction, budget,
                    seasonal trends, promotions, & ect. All of these factors currently require the user to manually
                    research and this can be incredibly tedious and time consuming.<br>
                    <br>
                    We hope to solve this problem by creating an application that uses machine learning to curate
                    experiences and restaurants based on the user’s historical behavior, preferences, circle of
                    connection, location, trends, and various other data points. We will begin this by administering a
                    short questionnaire after signing up. Afterwards, the app will allow the user to connect their Vos
                    profile to other apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Groupon, and ect. The app will
                    use these 3rd party apps to learn about the user’s historical behavior, preferences, and circle of
                    friends. Overtime, the app will become smarter and be able recommend experiences and restaurants
                    that the user will enjoy without having to spend so much time and energy searching on their own.

                <p>

                <h3>Surveys</h3>
                <p>
                    We started off our survey by asking the user general questions regarding their background so that
                    we could profile our general user base. What we learned here initially was that most of our users
                    are millennials. <br>
                    <br>
                    We then proceeded with asking respondents to identify what app they use when looking for places to
                    eat or activities to do. If the app we suggested were not available, users could provide a free
                    response. The purpose for this was so that we can identify our competitors and learn what drives
                    users to use those apps. From this, we found that the top 3 apps used for searching for places to
                    eat and activities were Google, Yelp, and Tripadvisor. We then proceeded with asking the
                    respondents to identify what they take into consideration when picking places to eat and activities
                    to do.<br>
                    <br>
                    For eating, the leading considerations were price (87.2%), reviews (76.9%), and location (66.7%).
                    This enabled us to quickly ideate the essential functions that our app must incorporate.<br>
                    <br>
                    For activities, the leading considerations were price (76.9%), location (71.8%), reviews (66.7%),
                    and recommendation from friends/family (61.5%). What was most unexpecting and crucial that we
                    learned from this study was that 61.5% of respondents rely on recommendations from friends/family.
                    This led us to ideate using machine learning to identify what the user’s circle of friends are
                    doing to recommend activities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, since our app’s value proposition is personalizing recommendations and ask users complete
                    short questionnaires, we wanted to see if users would respond to these features positively. From
                    this we found that 97.4% of respondents would like an app that can personalize their interest and
                    87.2% of respondents feel comfortable completing the short questionnaires.<br>

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    After learning what our respondents were using to search for places and activities to do, we ran an
                    analysis on our 3 leading competitors; Google, Yelp, and Tripadvisor. <br>

                <h3>User Interviews</h3>

                    1. Kim Yu is 29 years old and travels frequently. She uses yelp to search for restaurants in the US
                    but for international she uses Tripadvisor. She uses these apps primarily to see other people’s
                    reviews, to see pictures, and for convenience for looking up places in an unfamiliar area. Finally,
                    she indicates that she does see value from an app that personalizes recommendations for her and
                    would be comfortable answering questionnaires but it would have to be no more than 5 questions.

                    2. Jaylen is 23 years old and is an occasional traveler. He uses yelp, social medias, and
                    recommendations from friends when searching for places to eat or things to do. He uses yelp because
                    of the ease of access and allows him to quickly search up places based on distance, reviews, and
                    trend. He uses social media and recommendations from friends because he believes he will like
                    similar things as his friends or channels that he follows. He thinks that an app that personalizes
                    recommendation can offer a few things that he would enjoy but he is concerned that it will prevent
                    him from trying new things. Finally, he indicates that he would like to be able to see and use an
                    app before having to create an account. Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUCExb_aOIOVBDorlMj8JhUFC-zOTxXPJFWA4v22W0I/edit"><b><u>here</u></b></a>

                <p>
                    We then revised our proto-persona into a user persona to better reflect the findings in our UX

                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <p>
                    For our UX scenario, Olivia is traveling to Europe with her family but they are having difficulty
                    getting around in an unfamiliar country. She quickly realizes that everyone has different dietary
                    limitation or preference that is complicating their search for a place to eat. Fortunately, Vos
                    used geolocation technology to understand that Olivia was traveling with a group. The app then
                    seamlessly synced everyone’s profile together and used machine learning to ensure the recommended
                    restaurants are within everyone’s preference and dietary constraints.<br>
