        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Finance is a difficult subject to master and with countless financial products and a massive learning curve,
          it is very difficult for busy working professionals to dedicate their own time to learn this space and keeping
          up with the volatile market. We also found that since the 2008 financial crisis that many millennials became
          distrusting of financial institutions and reluctant to enter the equity market. To make matters worse, the
          economy has even been more difficult for younger generation due to much higher cost of living for the younger
          generations compared to baby boomers and generation X.<br>
          <br>
          We believe that millennials are having difficulty preparing for their future, staying up to date with their
          finances, and keeping up with their spending/budgeting habits because there is no easy-to-use tool on the
          market that helps the user build a financial plan. Squirrl may solve this problem by offering an AI financial
          advisor personalized for each individual user to accomplish specific goals.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Since finance is a very complex subject to understand with a very steep learning curve, the margin of error
          for making a critical design mistake is enormous. To overcome this first challenge, a significant amount of
          time needed to be devoted to better educating ourselves on this subject. However, we believed that even then
          it would not be enough to rely on only designers to build a financial app. As such, we proceeded with
          consulting with one of the top financial advisors from JPMorgan Chase. Then to ensure feasibility of our
          design, we also spent significant resource on building the prototype tool in excel to simulate some of the
          app's back-end features; for example, forecasting. But even though we went through these processes, we
          continued to encounter significant challenges with trying to simply such complex material into a mobile device
          format that delivered accurate, useful, usable, and user-friendly information for the user. This challenged us
          to create dozens of paper prototype iterations that constantly got revised after performing A/B testing.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
        <h2 id="SquirrlUXProcess"></h2>
        <p>
          Our app’s goal is to assist the user in making the best financial decisions possible given their financial
          state. We wanted to create an experience in which an individual with no financial background feels confident
          and in complete control of reaching their goal. Our UX process was to discover, define, design, and deliver
          the product.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>UX Process</h3>
        <p>
          Our UX process began with the '<a href="#SquirrlDiscover"><b>Discover</b></a>' phase by creating a proto
          persona, conducting surveys, performing researches, competitive analysis, and user interview. Afterwards we
          proceeded with
          '<a href="#SquirrlDefine"><b>Defining</b></a>' our ideal users by creating an empathy map, user persona,
          storyboard, and journey map. We then continued with '<a href="#SquirrlDesign"><b>Designing</b></a>' by
          creating
          an affinity diagrams, perform feasibility test, creating decision flow diagrams, paper prototypes, and perform
          A/B testing. Finally, to complete our UX process, we '<a href="#SquirrlDeliver"><b>Delivered</b></a>'
          wireframes, a style guide, and the high-fidelity prototype.
        </p>

        <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
        <p>
          For our app, we started with a hypothesis that our AI financial advisor app is more likely to attract
          millennials so we made this our target audience. Some reasons we believed millennials were the more likely
          to
          use this app were,
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-2" style="padding:0px;"></div>
      <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px;">
        <p style="text-align: left;">
          1. We believed many millennials today are struggling with the rising cost of living<br>
          2. Growing up through the 2009 recession played a major role in conditioning millennials to be more
          conscious
          of their spending and inadvertently reluctant of invest in the market<br>
          3. We believed many millennials now are in student debt and are looking for ways to get out of debt<br>
          4. We believed millennials are technology savvy and are not resistant to trying new apps<br>
          5. We believed millennials are now too busy to invest time into learning finance<br>
          6. We also believed many millennials want to start planning for their financial future but need help and
          aren’t sure how to start

        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <p>
          We started off our user research by trying to create a non-bias survey. To ensure the survey was neutral, we
          asked a broad range of questions regarding the topic of finance. We started off with questions to learn
          about
          our demographic by
          asking questions regarding age, current financial state, current income, & etc. Then our survey dove into
          questions regarding the user’s current financial behavior, their current financial plan, their future
          financial plan, and any tools/methods they currently use to plan their financial future. In total, we asked
          24 questions. Below are some examples of respondents from our survey that supported our hypothesis with
          possible solution.<br>
          <br>
          With the exception of possibly 1 individual, all 27 of our respondents were Millennials or Gen Z.<br>
          <img src="img/squirrl/squirrl-survey-01.png" class="img" style="height:50%; width:50%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          40.7% of respondants do not have a good handle on their finances and financial future while 11.1% are
          unsure.<br>
          <img src="img/squirrl/squirrl-survey-02.png" class="img" style="height:50%; width:50%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          However, we found that 92.6% of respondents plan to invest more money than they currently do. <br>
          <img src="img/squirrl/squirrl-survey-03.png" class="img" style="height:50%; width:50%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          But on a scale of 1-5, over half of respondents believe they are not educated enough in stocks of similar
          types of equity investment.<br>
          <img src="img/squirrl/squirrl-survey-04.png" class="img" style="height:50%; width:50%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          The problem we found was that a significant number of respondents (44.4%) do not know what steps to take to
          gain control of their finance.<br>
          <img src="img/squirrl/squirrl-survey-05.png" class="img" style="height:50%; width:50%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          We prepared several possible solutions to encourage users to better budget and plan for their financial
          future. From our surveys we found that 59.3% wanted an app that can track their spending and 48.1% wanted an
          app that can simulate their budget.<br>
          <img src="img/squirrl/squirrl-survey-06.png" class="img" style="height:50%; width:50%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          Then we asked respondents to provide the name of any tool/apps they currently use to manage their finance.
          Our plan was to later run a competitive analysis and exploit the weakness and strength of each of these
          tools/apps.<br>

            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Article Research</h3>
        <p>From our above surveys we found several repeating patterns from our respondents so we searched for news
          articles to support these findings. In total, we reviewed 14 articles from multiple sources. Our objective
          here was to learn more about our target demographic and their user problems. The subject we researched were,

      <div class="col-sm-8" style="padding:10px;">

          1. Millennials want to save money<br>
          2. Millennials want to plan for their financial future but lack tools and knowledge<br>
          3. Millennials fear the stock market<br>
          4. Millennials are stuck with student debt<br>
          5. Millennials want to save up for a home but have no way to plan or afford one<br>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Afterwards we dove into running a competitive analysis on all the apps/tools that our users mentioned. We
          also took the liberty to search for any additional apps on the market that may possibly solve this user
          problem. For each competitor, we evaluated their market cap, user base, revenue model, value proposition,
          target demographic, unique feature, and then ran a SWOT analysis. The key takeaway from our competitive
          analysis was that we found BoA and Mint to be direct competitors.<br>
          <br>
          BoA’s key strength that we wanted to adopt was their app’s ability for the user to easily understand their
          spending habit and to set budgets. However, a major weakness of their app is that they cannot run this
          analysis on non-BoA accounts and their app cannot simulate a budget plan or keeping track and guide the user
          in real-time.<br>
          <br>
          Mint’s key strength we wanted to adopt was their ability to consolidate all the user’s financial accounts
          into one view. However, their major weakness is an inconsistent UI, steep learning curve, too many
          irrelevant
          functions + views, and it does not simulate a budget plan or keep track and guide the user in real-time.<br>
          <br>

          to view the competitive analysis.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Consulting Financial Advisor</h3>
        <p>We consulted Frank Kuo, a financial advisor from Chase Bank and the #1 performing banker in 2017. From our
          preliminary consultation, we received 3 key feedbacks.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Frank strongly believes an app like this will attract mostly Millennials so our app should focus on this
          demographic.<br>
          <br>
          2. Most of Frank’s client have zero understanding of finance and will frequently derail from financial plans
          that Frank prepared for the client. To defer clients from derailing from the plan, Frank will engage,
          educate, ensure, and review/revise the plan with the client. Our app needs to simulate this.<br>
          <br>
          3. Finally, Frank strongly encouraged a minimalistic design and ways to dumb down finance terminology
          because
          of the complexity of the subject.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>User Interview</h3>
        <p>After conducting the surveys, researching millennial’s financial behavior, and consulting a financial
          advisor, we started getting a stronger idea of what our general audience looks like. Our ideal audience is a
          millennial, focusing on their career, very busy and has little time to manage their finance, paying off
          their
          student debt, technology savvy, trying to save money, trying to start investing, but is very concerned about
          the future since the grew up through the economic recession in 2009. This led us to seek out several
          candidates to interview that may fall into this group. We interviewed 3 individuals.<br>
          <br>
          1. Livia, a 24 year old lab assistant that just paid off her student debt and is now actively trying to
          learn
          how to invest money, focusing on paying for grad school, and saving up for a house. Click <a

          for the transcript.<br>
          <br>
          2. Louise, a 27 finance analyst that is trying to save money, get into real estate, stocks, or other types
          of
          investments and eventually own a home. Click <a

        <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
        <p>
          After completing our user research, we felt we had a strong understanding of our users and so we proceeded
          with building an empathy map.

        <br>


        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>
          We also proceeded with revising our proto-persona into a user persona to better reflect what we learned from
          our user research.</p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <h3>Storyboard & Journey Map</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of our app was an artificial intelligent financial advisor app so we conceptualize a user
          problem that could be solved if a user had access to financial advice from a financial advisor from the
          convenience of their mobile phone at any time. From that, we proceeded with drawing a storyboard.

        <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
        <p>
          After the user research and competitive analysis was complete we started taking notes of all the features
          our app could incorporate. We used stickies to create an affinity diagram.</p>

        <h3>Feasibility Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Since finance is a very complex subject, we wanted to make sure what we were building is feasible so for
          each
          of our competitors we downloaded their apps to use and test.<br>
          <br>
          One tool we found and really liked was the Chase Bank’s retirement plan calculator. This is a tool that a
          financial advisor typically uses after asking the client for their basic financial information and
          retirement
          goal. After they enter the client’s information into the tool, the tool would export over a dozen pages of
          graphs and tables that shows projections for the user’s timeline to hit their retirement goal. What we also
          noticed was that this formula also allows the user to simulate the client’s future net worth (left diagram).
          However, this tool was very limited for the simulation because the tool was restricted for retirement
          planning.<br>
          <br>
          After we successfully replicated Chase’s tool through excel, we created a new tool in excel and tweaked
          Chase’s formula to solve our user scenario (right diagram). All the numbers from our prototype is derived
          from this tool.

          <h3>Decision Flow Diagram</h3>
          <p>
            For our decision flow diagram, we wanted to start with the onboarding process. The reason for this is
            because a financial advisor’s (FA) first task is to profile a user. Our app would have to simulate this by
            asking a variety of questionnaires that an FA would typically ask their client. We started with a
            Microsoft word document (click <a
              href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=12YpHt0sO6K8IZ8aIc77l3zN7KDPiMxrJ"><b><u>here</u></b></a> to view)
            to document these questionnaires and then proceeded with making the decision flow diagram.</p>

          <h3>Paper Prototype & A/B Testing</h3>
          <p>
            For our prototype, we wanted to build the feature that solves Celeste’s user scenario. The assumption here
            is that she already spent 10-15min setting up her Squirrl account via the decision flow diagram presented
            above. We created several paper prototype versions but these two were the strongest based on our user
            testing. From our A/B testing, the 2nd version was preferred because the dashboard simplified the
            financial products into 3 buckets. These buckets represent how immediate the user needs their money.<br>

          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            In our wireframe stage, we used boxes and color schemes. The boxes allowed us to re-arrange, reiterate,
            and
            test different versions.
            The colors also allowed us to rapidly experiment with how the colors impacted our brand and the feel of
            the
            app.<br>

          <br>

          <h3>Style Guide</h3>
          <p>
            For our color, we chose purple because through centuries it has been associated with royalty and wealth.
            We
            chose orange because it is associated with enthusiasm and success. Finally, we chose green because it is
            associated with growth and money. For the font we picked vanguard because sans font works well with mobile
            apps and the style is trending with other finance apps. For our iconography, we also wanted to create some
            symbols that represented our mascot so acorns and a money bag with leaf were designed.</p>
