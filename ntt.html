        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          My role at the company began as an analyst for pricing, finance, and complex deals. It then expanded to being
          a pricing architect; designing and building pricing tools that are used across the entire pricing team.
          However less than a year after joining the company, our company went through a merge with another network
          company called Virtela. During this merge, Virtela developed a new platform that was streamlined across
          NTTCom. This new platform was how our global business units interfaced with Virtela’s product line. However,
          during the time that the platform was being built, none of their developers and product managers consulted
          with us. This caused the platform to have disastrous incompatibility & inefficiencies with our systems,
          work-flow, resulting in poor user experience, and included countless of bugs and errors. Teams that were
          impacted by this flawed system included analysts, engineers, sales, project managers, and service ordering
          team.<br>
          <br>
          My accomplishment for designing and building our pricing tools was embraced by management, and afterwards my
          subsequent projects at NTT America became more design-intensive. Not long after, I was assigned to work with
          the developers to re-design the platform and work-flow. Over the last 4 years this was an active role I was
          involved in.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Since the platform was already implemented, making changes was incredibly challenging because it affected our
          business flow in real-time. As my VP once pointed out, "<i>We are changing parts on a moving plane</i>". This
          required me to carefully plan and anticipate how every change I made impacted other teams and the business
          process. To overcome this challenge, I had to learn the entire work-flow of various other teams, identifying
          their pain points, identify inefficiencies & incompatibility, and then communicating the re-design to the
          developers and product manager. <br>
          <br>
          Before I knew what UX design was, I also faced the challenge of presenting my designs. I had to get creative
          in solving UX problems by using any tools available. I would draw and sketch ideas on paper and even redline
          and annotate design requirements for the developers using 'Microsoft Paint'. I also had a strong background in
          some coding languages (PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL) so I also reviewed the developer’s code to help them
          identify what was causing some of the bugs/errors/and performance issues. To communicate to management my
          progress and recommendations for work-flow changes, I created PowerPoints for my presentations.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The design goal was to improve our business profitability by identifying and re-designing all the inefficient
          processes, tools, and systems.

        <h3>Pricing Tool</h3>
        <p>
          In the past when our pricing team gathered cost inputs for some of our products, they had to manually search
          through multiple pricelist file. The pricelist (see exhibit 1) has thousands of rows and with dozens of
          columns. The pricing analyst has to match up the parameters that the sales and engineer request get the cost
          of the product. Afterwards they will copy and paste the cost into document, search up another file for the
          most recent tax and additional fee rate card, and then calculate the customer facing price. This process took
          the pricing analyst anywhere from 3-10 minute per line item to get from cost to customer facing.<br>
          <br>
          <img class="" src="img/ntt/al-fp.JPG" alt="Image" style="height:90%; width:90%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          <b><i>Exhibit 1. Pricelist: Confidential price section blacked out</i></b><br>
          <br>
          However, what I quickly realized was that these manual steps that the pricing analyst took could be
          replicated in formulas. What I created were multiple long if-statement functions (see exhibit 2) and
          concatenated
          them together to create a unique ID# (gray columns in exhibit 1). The if-statement function (exhibit 2) will
          look
          at all the values that the user entered and combine all the inputs together into a variable. This variable
          would then automatically cross-reference with the unique ID I created in the pricelist (gray column in
          exhibit 1). If the formula found a match between the variable and the unique ID from the pricelist, it will
          automatically extract the pricing that the analyst needed.<br>
          <br>
          <img class="" src="img/ntt/the-code.JPG" alt="Image" style="height:90%; width:90%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          <b><i>Exhibit 2. The code.</i></b><br>
          <br>
          After several iterations and feedback from all the pricing analysts on the team, I was able to find the most
          efficient & minimalistic way to design the tool (exhibit 3) and still preserved all the functions of my code.
          In the end, all the analyst had to type into the tool exactly what they wanted and the pricing will
          auto-populate for them, add tax, add fees, calculate margin, and prepare the customer facing price. A work
          that used to take 3-10min per line item now only took a few seconds to complete.<br>

          <b><i>Exhibit 3. Pricing Tool: Price in example is arbitrary & for demonstration purpose only</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Pre-Sales Portal</h3>
        <p>
          For any network product that is not standardized into a pricelist we have to rely on a team at Virtela to
          provide us the cost inputs for each of the components. The pricing process starts with an engineer validating
          technical requirements to a pricing analyst that will later fill into an excel that we call the RFQ (request
          for quote). Afterwards the analyst logs into the Pre-Sales Portal; the internal CRM system that Virtela
          created. This system is how the analyst communicates with the Virtela’s team across the globe. The analyst
          will then upload the RFQ into the portal which will then transfer all the data of the requests into to the
          system. From that point on, the RFQ is no longer need since the system allows the user to modify and adjust
          the technical requirements. See below for the user flow.<br>
          <br>
          My role was to work with the product managers in Japan to manage the information architect between the RFQ
          and Pre-Sales Portal. Every time we have new product or modification, the RFQ would need to be updated and
          then coordinated with the developers for an update. We also had to do usability testing with other teams from
          our sister companies around the globe to ensure the RFQ and system are also compatible with their work-flow
          and system. If there was incompatibility, we had to go back to the product manager and find an alternative
          solution. An example would be to re-bundle certain product into a new product code in the drop-down menu so
          that the revised product code is consistent across multiple systems.
          <br>

            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Chat Feature</h3>
        <p>
          Almost all of the analysts that we work with from Virtela are overseas. Typically, when a request goes into
          the Pre-Sales Portal, it will get filtered down to one of hundreds of analysts around the world and sometimes
          these projects will get passed from one individual to the next at Virtela. This created a problem for
          engineers and project managers later if a conversation was not digitally recorded.<br>
          <br>
          To solve this problem, Virtela came up with an outlook notification message that gets sent to us every time
          one of the pricing analyst overseas sent us a message. However, this messaging method was incredibly
          inefficient for two reasons. First, the notification would get clumped into one huge text file. This made it
          very difficult to read when we had complex designs that had paragraphs of details. Second, the messages did
          not contain any of the history of the chat; each message they sent came in as a separate email notification.
          This required anyone viewing the messages to manually dig out all the previous notifications to see the
          conversation history.<br>
          <br>
          My solution was for the developers to add HTML tags into the notification so that when outlook views the
          message, the message would be organized. I also worked with the developers to include the entire conversation
          history in each of the notifications.<br>
          <img class="" src="img/ntt/outlook-chat.png" alt="Image" style="height:75%; width:75%; cursor:pointer"
            onclick="onClick(this)"><br>
          <br>
          After resolving the issue with the outlook, we started realizing that outlook was not the best way to capture
          the technical requirements because the customer’s request was changing so rapidly. Since outlook
          notifications did not show the user a complete overview of what is going on, responses caused errors to
          happen frequently. What I came up with was to implement a chat system directly into the Post-Sales Portal.
          This enabled the user and Virtela to identify specific line items in the system they are inquiring about.
          This started with a quick wireframe in Microsoft paint and the developers soon updated this feature into the
          Pre-Sales Portal. This allowed the user to quickly respond to the Virtela team with accuracy and improved
          resource since the user did not have to jump between two systems at the same time.<br>
